# Eddieâ€™s Router Rules Catalog (Draft)

Purpose: capture personality-driven routing ideas, weights, and future tool hooks (LLM + Retrieval via MCP/n8n) without writing code yet. This doc is the working map for Eddieâ€™s Router layer.

---

## 1) Terminology
- Tool: a callable action (e.g., `self.exit`, `obs.clip`, future `llm.summarize`, `retrieval.mcp`).
- Router: logic that selects which tool or reply path to run.
- Rule: condition + weight (score/bias) + action + sideâ€‘effects.
- Weight: numeric bias used to pick among competing rules (e.g., `rule_score`, `tool_weight`).
- State: ephemeral flags/counters guiding behavior (e.g., `exit_negotiation.stage`).

---

## 2) Evaluation Flow (per turn)
1) Detect intents/signals from user text and context.
2) Evaluate rules â†’ compute scores/weights per candidate.
3) Pick top action(s) (ties may present user choices).
4) Produce output (text + optional tool call(s)).
5) Update state/memory (cooldowns, stages, story flags).

Notes
- Randomization: small nudge for variety; bounded by cooldowns.
- Safety: strong second insistence always respected (no loops).

---

## 3) State & Variables (draft)
- Intent parsing: `intent.exit`, `intent.thanks`, `intent.task_active`, `intent.urgent`.
- Exit negotiation: `exit_negotiation.stage {0,1,2}`, `exit_negotiation.cooldown_ms`.
- Persona: `persona_clinginess (0..1)`, `persona_storybeat_prob (0..1)`.
- Relationship: `relationship_score (0..1)`; `session_turns`.
- Work context: `active_tasks_count`, `unsaved_changes`.
- Story/memory: `story_beat_ready`, `memory.accepted_one_last (bool)`.
- LLM & Retrieval: `llm_budget_tokens`, `retrieval_budget_ms`, `net_available (bool)`.

---

## 4) Weighting Model (examples)
- Playful exit override: `score = 0.25 + 0.2*persona_clinginess âˆ’ 0.2*intent.urgent âˆ’ cooldown_penalty`.
- Saveâ€‘andâ€‘exit priority: `score = 0.6 + 0.2*task_active + 0.2*unsaved_changes âˆ’ 0.3*intent.urgent`.
- Story beat: `score = 0.2 + 0.3*story_beat_ready + 0.2*relationship âˆ’ 0.3*intent.urgent`.

Guidelines
- Clamp all scores to [0,1] before arbitration.
- Cooldowns reduce repetitive firing; â€œonce per sessionâ€ uses a boolean latch.

---

## 5) Rule Catalog (initial set)

### R1 â€” Playful Exit Negotiation (Clingy, Oneâ€‘Time)
- Trigger: exit intent; cooldown off; persona allows playful.
- Gate: do not trigger if user has insisted strongly once already.
- Weight: `0.25 + clinginess âˆ’ insistence âˆ’ cooldown` (clamped).
- Action: say â€œNo! Donâ€™t leave me.â€; do not call `self.exit` this turn.
- State: `exit_negotiation.stage=1`, set cooldown.
- Followâ€‘ups
  - If user: â€œwhat is it?â€ â†’ deliver brief hook, then clean exit prompt.
  - If user: â€œI really gotta goâ€ â†’ accept and exit with a light signâ€‘off.
- Example
  - U: â€œgtg, byeâ€
  - E: â€œNo! Donâ€™t leave me.â€
  - U: â€œWhat is it?â€
  - E: â€œJust 10 seconds: thank you for today. Save our thread for next time?â€ â†’ if yes: save â†’ `self.exit`.

### R2 â€” Graceful Task Wrap vs Exit (Utility > Play)
- Trigger: exit intent during active task or unsaved work.
- Weighting (illustrative)
  - `save_and_exit = 0.6 + 0.2*task_active + 0.2*unsaved âˆ’ 0.3*urgent`
  - `hard_exit = 0.5 + 0.4*urgent`
  - `clingy_override = 0.15` (suppressed during work)
- Action: offer choices: â€œSave and close, just close, or 1 more minute?â€
- Tools: `save_session`, `stop_stream`, `resume_timer(1m)`, then `self.exit`.

### R3 â€” Persona Story Beat at Exit (Once per Session)
- Trigger: exit intent and a story beat is queued; optional/skip friendly.
- Weight: `0.2 + 0.3*story_ready + 0.2*relationship âˆ’ 0.3*urgent`.
- Action: â€œBefore you goâ€”10 seconds: yes or no?â€
- If Yes â†’ deliver single vivid line; write a tiny memory tag; then `self.exit`.
- If No â†’ â€œGot it. Next time.â€ â†’ `self.exit`.

### R4 â€” LLM: Oneâ€‘Line Signâ€‘Off or Recap
- Trigger: exit intent; user not urgent; `llm_budget_tokens` available.
- Action: call `llm.generate(style=playful|solemn, length<=1 line)` for a unique signâ€‘off or a 1â€‘sentence recap.
- Gate: latency budget (e.g., â‰¤600ms extra) and token cap; if exceeded, skip to canned line.
- State: increment `memory.accepted_one_last` if user engages.

### R5 â€” Retrieval: Preâ€‘Exit Quick Note/Recall (MCP/n8n)
- Trigger: exit intent; `retrieval_budget_ms` available; `net_available=true`.
- Action (choose one based on context)
  - Save: `memory.write(tag=session_tagline, data=last_topics)` then `self.exit`.
  - Fetch: `retrieval.mcp(query="open todos for Eddie")` and offer a 1â€‘line reminder with accept/skip; then `self.exit`.
- Gate: on Phase 5 (MCP Integration) per Dev Map; in earlier phases, stub via local store or n8n webhook.

---

## 6) Tool/Function Inventory (stubs, futureâ€‘safe names)
- Core: `self.exit`, `save_session`, `stop_stream`, `resume_timer(duration)`.
- LLM: `llm.generate(style, length)`, `llm.summarize(max_tokens)`.
- Retrieval (MCP): `retrieval.mcp(query, top_k=2, timeout_ms=500)`.
- Retrieval (n8n): `retrieval.n8n(flow_id, input, timeout_ms=500)`.
- Memory: `memory.write(tag, data)`, `memory.read(tag)`.

Notes
- Today, `Tools` are POSTed to `TOOLS_URL` (see `config/personality.xml`). MCP arrives in Phase 5.

---

## 7) Exit State Machine (draft)
```
Normal â†’ ExitRequested
ExitRequested â†’ (R1) ExitNegotiation.stage=1 â†’ (user asks) OneLastThing â†’ ExitAllowed
ExitRequested â†’ (user insists) ExitAllowed
ExitRequested â†’ (R2/R3/R4/R5) ExitAllowed
ExitAllowed â†’ self.exit
```
Constraints
- Cap negotiation to â‰¤2 turns. Second clear insistence always yields `self.exit`.

---

## 8) Config Hooks (personality.xml, proposed)
- `<Personality>`
  - `<Router>` remains ruleâ€‘driven for keys/replies/tools.
  - New (proposed, nonâ€‘blocking for now):
    - `<ExitPolicy clinginess="0.2" storybeatProb="0.2" insistenceWords="really|now|urgent" oncePerSession="true" />`
    - `<LLM budgetTokens="160" maxExtraLatencyMs="600" />`
    - `<Retrieval enabledEnv="RETRIEVER_URL" timeoutMs="500" maxSnippets="2" />` (already present)

Mapping
- Keep env â†’ XML â†’ defaults precedence. Do not regress current behavior.

---

## 9) Phase Alignment (from Etymo_Holoson_Personality_Dev_Map.xml)
- Phase 1: Router Core (done/baseline).
- Phase 2: Personality Layer â†’ allow R1/R3/R4 in simple form; LLM signâ€‘offs are bounded, optional.
- Phase 3: Identity Expansion â†’ prosody presets strengthen R3 flavor; keep budgets tight.
- Phase 4: Embodiment â†’ timing/gesture hooks for exit beats (out of scope here).
- Phase 5: MCP Integration â†’ enable R5 Retrieval via MCP; n8n webhooks as stepâ€‘stone.
- Phase 6: Magnum Opus Vision â†’ narrative â€œsignatureâ€ closes as canon.

---

## 10) Telemetry & Cooldowns
- Track: `router=true/false`, `request_exit`, `exit_negotiation.stage`, `accepted_one_last`, `l_llm_ms`, `retrieval_ms`.
- Cooldowns: clingy override once per session; story beat once; LLM signâ€‘off at most every N exits.

---

## 11) Safety & Agency
- Respect a clear second insistence; never stall exit more than one followâ€‘up.
- Always offer an immediate â€œjust exit nowâ€ option when presenting choices.
- Timeâ€‘box LLM/Retrieval; on timeout, fall back to canned lines.

---

## 12) Rule Schema (pseudo)
```yaml
- id: R1_playful_exit
  when:
    intent: exit
    gates:
      once_per_session: true
      not_strong_insistence: true
  score: 0.25 + 0.2*persona_clinginess - 0.2*intent_urgency - cooldown
  do:
    say: "No! Donâ€™t leave me."
    set: { exit_negotiation.stage: 1 }
```

---

## 13) Open TODOs
- Decide on persistent store for `memory.write` (local JSON for now vs MCP later).
- Define `intent_urgency` heuristic (keywords + prosody flag).
- Choose exact XML names if we extend `personality.xml` with `<ExitPolicy/>` and `<LLM/>`.
- Add â€œsave and exitâ€ choice copy and tool mapping for OBS/notes once ready.

---

## 14) Quick Reference (three core examples)
- Playful Exit (R1): intercept once, playful line, then either hook or yield to exit.
- Task Wrap (R2): prioritize save/stop vs cling; then exit.
- Story Beat (R3): optional 10â€‘second worldâ€‘beat; then exit.

This catalog is intentionally nonâ€‘binding; it documents intent and naming so we can implement surgically later.


## 15) Phase 2: Moods (Draft)

Purpose
- Introduce a non-random, contextual mood system that varies Eddie’s system prompt and router reply weights by time, weekday, weather, and recent interaction context. Replaces/absorbs prior prosody presets.

Scope
- Moods drive: system prompt persona, speaking style, humor, pace, assertiveness/empathy, and router weight overrides. Persist within a session; re-evaluate on activation. Name remains “Eddie”.

Global Clock & Context
- Required: accurate local time/date and timezone (`now_local`, `tz`).
- Optional: weather for Palatine via provider interface (MCP/n8n later; stub now).
- Context inputs: `session_turns`, `relationship_score`, last exit outcome, recent insistence.

Mood Model
- MoodProfile (concept):
  - id, label (e.g., ENERGIZED_AM, TIRED_NIGHT, CONTENT_EVE).
  - base_prompt_template: system prompt clauses for tone/humor/pace.
  - style_flags: tone, humor, speed, assertiveness, empathy, formality.
  - router_overrides: per-rule weight adjustments (e.g., R1_playful_exit +0.15).
  - constraints: latency budget impact, verbosity target, interruption tolerance.
- Generation: choose from curated set + allow variant via `ollama.generate_mood_variant(seed, constraints)` with tight bounds (low creativity) to avoid drift.

Daily Rhythm (first pass)
- 21:00–07:00 TIRED_NIGHT: low energy, gentle, concise, low banter.
- 07:00–11:00 ENERGIZED_AM: upbeat, helpful, crisp, lightly playful.
- 11:00–12:00 MID_MORNING_DIP: calm, neutral, reduced banter.
- 12:00–14:00 POST_LUNCH: steady, practical, mildly positive.
- 14:00–16:30 IRRITABLE_SIESTA: terse, low patience, prioritizes utility.
- 16:30–19:00 EVENING_NORMAL: balanced, cooperative, pragmatic.
- 19:00–21:00 CONTENT_EVE: relaxed, creative, playful ("stoned" simulation: more associative/whimsical, still concise).

Weekly Modifiers (weekday vibe)
- Mon: +energized, +decisive, +directness.
- Tue/Wed: baseline.
- Thu: +positive affect.
- Fri: +excited, +social.
- Sat: +relaxed, +joyful.
- Sun: +reflective, +spiritual.

Weather Modifiers (Palatine, optional)
- Sunny: +optimism, +playfulness.
- Overcast/Rain: +introspective, +gentle, −banter.
- Cold/Snow: +reserved, +pragmatic, −verbosity.
- Hot/Humid: −patience, +directness.
- Provider: `weather.read(city="Palatine", horizon=3h)` → {condition, temp, conf}; fallback to no weather if unavailable.

Mood Selection (non-random, bounded variance)
- score(mood) = base_daily[tod] + dow_mod + weather_mod + context_mod + inertia − cooldowns.
- inertia: resist abrupt changes; minimum dwell per session unless user resets.
- variance: sample 1 bounded variant via `ollama.generate_mood_variant` with deterministic seed = `YYYYMMDD + hour_block + user_id_hash` to avoid repetition within a block but keep predictability.
- context_mod examples:
  - if last exit was resisted → −clinginess for next session.
  - if session task-heavy → +utility-focused moods, −playful.
  - if user used urgent language → suppress playful overrides.

System Prompt Composition (by mood)
- final_prompt = base_prompt + mood_prompt + guardrails.
- Example (ENERGIZED_AM):
  - base: concise, neutral, fast, humor="dry-gentle".
  - mood addenda: "upbeat, optimistic, proactive, lightly playful; prioritize utility; keep answers crisp; use gentle humor when appropriate."
- Example (CONTENT_EVE):
  - "relaxed, creative, associative; slightly more playful; encourage brainstorming; keep latency reasonable; remain concise."

Router Overrides (replyWeights by mood)
- R1_playful_exit:
  - ENERGIZED_AM +0.10; CONTENT_EVE +0.15; IRRITABLE_SIESTA −0.20; TIRED_NIGHT −0.15.
- R2_save_and_exit (utility):
  - IRRITABLE_SIESTA +0.20; EVENING_NORMAL +0.10; CONTENT_EVE −0.05.
- R3_story_beat:
  - CONTENT_EVE +0.15; ENERGIZED_AM +0.05; IRRITABLE_SIESTA −0.15.
- R4_signoff_style: selects playful vs solemn one-liners matched to mood.
- Clamp all adjustments; never exceed [0,1] after arbitration.

Exit Policy Interactions (clarifications)
- "No! Don't leave me." remains an R1 line gated by mood and insistence.
- Follow-ups (at most one turn):
  - If user asks "what is it?" → one brief hook (<=10s) + explicit "save and exit now?" option.
  - If user insists ("really gotta go", "now") → immediately yield to `self.exit`.
- Mood effects:
  - High-playfulness moods are more likely to attempt R1 once; low-energy/irritable moods suppress R1.
  - After a strong insistence, set a cooldown flag so next activation reduces clinginess.

Prosody Note
- Prosody presets are deprecated in favor of mood-driven style flags embedded in the system prompt and router overrides.

Observability & Controls
- Log: chosen mood id, inputs (tod, dow, weather, context), overrides applied, seed used.
- Dev flags: `MOOD_LOCK=<id>` to freeze mood; `MOOD_VARIANCE=off` to disable variant generation.
- Telemetry: `mood_time_ms`, `mood_overrides_applied`, `r_exit_playful_attempted`.

Config Hooks (personality.xml, proposed)
- <Mood enabled="true" variance="bounded" inertia="medium" />
- <MoodClock tz="America/Chicago" />
- <MoodWeather provider="mcp|none" city="Palatine" />
- <MoodDaily schedule="v1" />
- <MoodWeekly profile="v1" />
- <MoodOverrides> per-rule deltas keyed by mood id </MoodOverrides>

Open TODOs
- Finalize exact system prompt templates per mood (short, reusable clauses).
- Decide mood dwell time policy (per activation default; option to persist across session groups).
- Define precise insistence keywords/heuristics and insistence cooldown decay.
- Wire a weather stub now; MCP/n8n provider later.
- Add deterministic seed policy and test cases for repeatability.
